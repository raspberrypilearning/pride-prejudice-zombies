## Zombie Austen

- So far you've been working on just a few sentences, but the code you have written will work on large texts as well.

- There are a huge number of books, now in the public domain, that are available on the [Project Gutenberg website](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Included in the archive is Jane Austen's book - [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt)

- You can use Python, to fetch this book from the website, but you'll need to use the requests module. Import the module, along with your other modules.

	```python
	import re
	from random import choice
	from requests import get
	```

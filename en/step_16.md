title: Taking it further
---
--- challenge ---
Here are a few ideas for how to take your script a little further:
- At the moment, although the `change_prose` function replaces text with both upper and lowercase letters, it always replaces them with lowercase `zombie`. Can you change this so that the word `zombie` is in a matching case?
- Can you add more word lists that can be changed? For instance, change all mentions of any food or meals to `brainz`.
- Can you try your program on other books, and see whether you need to change any of the code to make it handle multiple different texts?
